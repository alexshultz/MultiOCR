  "project_overview": {
    "objective": "Develop a Python-based tool for processing scanned documents using OCR. The tool processes input files/directories, filters by file type, and includes depth control for directory traversal. It also has a diagnostics mode for detailed debugging."
  },
  "current_state": {
    "implemented_features": {
      "file_handling": [
        "Accepts files or directories",
        "Filters based on file types from filetypes.txt or filetypes.json"
      ],
      "directory_traversal": "--depth flag for limiting the depth of directory search",
      "diagnostics": "--diagnostics flag for detailed debug information",
      "supported_file_types": "PDFs, PNGs, JPGs, etc., defined in an external file"
    },
    "testing_status": "Depth control has been successfully tested and is working correctly"
  },
  "tools_and_technologies": {
    "language": "Python",
    "libraries": ["os", "argparse", "json"],
    "command_line_flags": {
      "depth": "Limits directory traversal depth",
      "diagnostics": "Enables verbose/debugging mode"
    },
    "external_configuration": "filetypes.txt or filetypes.json: Stores supported file types"
  },
  "next_steps": {
    "integrate_ocr_systems": [
      "Start with Tesseract OCR",
      "Add optional multi-system comparison (Google Cloud Vision, Apple Vision Framework)"
    ],
    "further_optimizations": [
      "Add image pre-processing features for quality improvement",
      "Add additional flags for OCR customization (e.g., output formats)"
    ]
  },
  "example_usage": {
    "with_diagnostics": "python get_input.py --depth 1 --diagnostics",
    "without_diagnostics": "python get_input.py --depth 1"
  },
  "key_considerations": {
    "memory_constraints": "User expressed concerns about memory as the project grows",
    "modularity": "Current structure is modular, allowing independent development of components"
  },
  "summary": "The tool is stable for file input handling and depth management. Next steps include integrating OCR systems and expanding functionality."
