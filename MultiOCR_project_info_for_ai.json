        "objective": "Develop a Python-based tool for processing scanned documents using OCR. The tool processes input files/directories, filters by file type, and includes depth control for directory traversal. It also has a diagnostics mode for detailed debugging. Additionally, the project now includes modular OCR processing, starting with the integration of Tesseract OCR."
